/**
 * Ground metres per source pixel exists twice in this repo, and the two copies
 * were 2.8x apart on paper without ever having been fed the same input.
 *
 *   `work/ocr/scripts/scale.py`   `metres_per_pixel()` — least-squares affine
 *      over a sheet's whole set of GCPs, then the magnitude of each column of
 *      the fit. One number for the whole sheet, per image axis, in metres per
 *      *source* pixel. Reports 0.999 m/px for the 1959 Đô thành Sài Gòn sheet.
 *
 *   `scripts/collection_aoi.mjs`   `aoiInPixels()` — the study area's true
 *      ground area divided by the pixel area it maps onto through the Allmaps
 *      transform, square-rooted. Rotation- and skew-invariant, and *local* to
 *      that rectangle rather than global to the sheet. Feeds the D4 table that
 *      reports 2.80 m/px for the same 1959 sheet, which is the figure
 *      `docs/pipelines.md` § Full resolution derives "6.5 m/px delivered" and
 *      "cannot resolve a street name" from.
 *
 * Same pattern as `tests/density-parity.spec.ts`: one committed fixture of real
 * bytes, both implementations run against it, and a tolerance chosen to catch a
 * 3x disagreement rather than a 3% one. A gap here does not look like a bug —
 * it looks like a sheet whose tile grid was sized for the wrong amount of
 * ground and came back thin.
 *
 * WHICH SHEET, AND WHY NOT THE 1959 ONE. The disputed sheet's GCPs are not
 * obtainable offline: nothing in the tree caches an annotation, and both
 * implementations fetch theirs (`annotations.allmaps.org`, or the mirrored
 * `annotation_url`) at run time. The only real georeference annotations
 * available without the network are five L7014 sheets removed from the tree in
 * 27f8e79f. Sheet 6330-4 is used here because it is the one whose graticule
 * (106.5–106.75 E, 10.75–11.0 N) contains the repo's own District 4 polygon —
 * so the *AOI* is real too, `work/analysis/district4/district4.geojson`
 * unchanged, and not a rectangle invented to make the test pass. Nothing here
 * is synthetic. What this cannot do is reproduce the 1959 number; what it does
 * instead is settle whether the two *methods* can differ by 2.8x at all.
 *
 * Neither implementation is touched by this file, deliberately. The area-ratio
 * side is reached through `tests/fixtures/mppAoiHarness.mjs`, which stands in
 * for the network and the database so the shipped script can run as written —
 * see that file's header for why an import is not possible, which is also why
 * these two had never met.
