/**
 * gen-changelog-shots.mjs — the pictures on /changelog.
 *
 * A version history that shows nothing is a list of claims. These are real
 * screenshots of running sites, which is also why there are only two of them:
 *
 *   changelog-7.0.webp  maparchive.vn as it stands
 *   changelog-2.1.webp  lqtue.github.io/VMA — the 2025 site, still published
 *
 * Versions 3.0 through 6.0 have no image and are not going to get one. There
 * is no deployed instance of any of them, and the code of, say, 4.0 against
 * today's database renders error pages rather than that version's front page —
 * a screenshot of it would be a lie about what shipped. An empty slot is
 * honest; a reconstruction is not.
 *
 * Both shots are deterministic on purpose. The front page's header slider
 * sweeps by itself until a reader touches it, so the script touches it —
 * a real pointerdown, which is the documented way the sweep stops — and then
 * pins the slider to the 1882 end. Without that, the frame lands wherever the
 * animation happened to be. The 2025 site gets its own furniture removed: the
 * notice we added in Sept 2026 pointing at maparchive.vn is 2026 chrome on a
 * 2025 page, and photographing it would date the picture wrongly.
 *
 *   node scripts/gen-changelog-shots.mjs
 *   CHANGELOG_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 node scripts/gen-changelog-shots.mjs
 *
 * Re-run it when a version ships, and add the row in
 * `src/routes/(editorial)/changelog/releases.ts`. Needs `cwebp` on PATH.
