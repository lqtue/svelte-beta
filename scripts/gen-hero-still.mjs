/**
 * gen-hero-still.mjs — the front page's header images.
 *
 * The header used to be the live OpenLayers hero, which cost every visitor
 * 179 kB of JavaScript and ~390 kB of basemap before the masthead painted. It
 * is two images now, cross-faded by the Today/1882 slider, and this is where
 * they come from: it drives the real `HeroDemo` section and photographs it
 * twice, so the header and the live demo below it are the same picture at the
 * same scale and rotation.
 *
 *   hero-now.webp   the modern city alone — the sequence's first beat
 *   hero-1882.webp  the composed frame: sheet, traced plots, placed labels
 *
 * Each is written twice, at 1600 and at 800 (`hero-now-800.webp`), which is the
 * `srcset` the header offers. Both cuts are regenerated together — a stale 800
 * beside a fresh 1600 is a phone showing last week's frame.
 *
 * The two passes are separate page loads rather than two moments in one, and
 * the first one **aborts the annotation request** on purpose. That is not a
 * trick to save a download — it is what makes the shot deterministic:
 * `HeroSequence.start()` catches a failed overlay by parking at stage 0 and
 * returning, so the sheet, the footprints and the labels never arrive and
 * there is no 1.5-second window to race. Shooting the live beat 0 instead
 * meant catching the frame between "the basemap painted" and "the sheet
 * starts fading in".
 *
 * Re-run it whenever `HERO_SHEET` on the home page changes, or when the fabric
 * is regenerated (`scripts/gen-hero-fabric.mjs`) and the drawing moves.
 *
 * **The committed stills are older than the current demo camera.** The live
 * section was refitted to frame the whole sheet; the header was deliberately
 * left on the earlier pinned close-up. Running this replaces the header with
 * the wide view — which is a decision to make, not a fix to apply.
 *
 *   npm run dev                     # or point HERO_BASE_URL at a preview
 *   node scripts/gen-hero-still.mjs
 *
 * Needs `vips` and `cwebp` on PATH (both come with the tile pipeline).
